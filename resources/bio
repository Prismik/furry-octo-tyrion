    There are some who call me Francis, and with a legitimate reason. It is indeed my name.
    My interests are closely related to developing clean, simple and beautiful designs.
    I believe that a minimalist yet functional approach is the proper way to design UIs. 
    In my spare time, I enjoy learning new technologies to create lasting stuff, video games and websites.

    I am presently studying software engineering at <i><a href="http://en.etsmtl.ca/en/home?lang=en-ca">École de Technologie Supérieure</a></i>.
